Below is a **clear, implementation-ready specification** tailored for **Net4Courier Import Module**, split into **(A) Mandatory vs Optional Fields** and **(B) UI Mapping (Screen-wise)**.
This is written so it can be **directly consumed by your development team** and mapped to database + MudBlazor UI.

---

# A. Mandatory vs Optional Fields (Import Shipments)

## 1. Import Master (MAWB / BL / Vehicle Level)

### ✅ Mandatory Fields (System will NOT allow save without these)

These uniquely identify an import movement and are required for manifest, customs, and reconciliation.

# B. Net4Courier Import Module – UI Mapping

Below is a **screen-by-screen UI architecture** recommended for MudBlazor.

---

## 1. Import Dashboard

**Purpose:** Quick operational visibility.

### Components

* Cards:

  * Today Arrivals
  * Pending Inscan
  * On-Hold Shipments
* Grid:

  * Import Ref No
  * Mode
  * Origin → Destination
  * ETA
  * Status
  * Action (View)

---

## 2. Create Import (Master Screen)

### Section 1: Import Basics

**(Mandatory highlighted visually)**

* Import Mode (Dropdown)
* Master Reference Type (MAWB / BL / Truck)
* Master Reference Number
* Carrier Name
* Origin Country + Port
* Destination Country + Port
* ETA
* Import Warehouse
* Status (Draft default)

---

### Section 2: Transport Details (Optional – collapsible)

* Flight No / Vessel Name
* Flight Date / Voyage No
* ETD
* Manifest Number
* Remarks

---

### Actions

* Save Draft
* Proceed to Bags

---

## 3. Bag / Container Management Screen

### Grid View

| Bag No | Shipments | Weight | Status | Action |
| ------ | --------- | ------ | ------ | ------ |

### Actions

* Add Bag
* Scan Bag Barcode
* View Shipments

---

## 4. Shipment Inscan Screen (Core Courier Screen)

### Top Panel

* Import Ref
* Bag Number (Scan / Select)
* Total vs Inscanned Count

### Shipment Grid

| Scan | AWB | Shipper | Consignee | Weight | Status |
| ---- | --- | ------- | --------- | ------ | ------ |

### Rules

* ❌ Shipments with **On-Hold status** cannot be added
* ✅ Barcode scan auto-adds shipment
* ✅ Duplicate AWB validation

---

## 5. Shipment Detail Drawer (Slide-in UI)

### Tabs

**Basic**

* AWB
* Shipper / Consignee
* Weight / Pieces
* Shipment Type

**Customs**

* Import Type
* Declared Value
* HS Code
* Customs Status
* Hold Reason

**Audit**

* Created By / Date
* Status Timeline

---

## 6. Customs Clearance Screen (Optional Role-Based)

* Filter by:

  * Import Type
  * Customs Status
* Bulk update:

  * Filed
  * Cleared
  * On Hold

---

## 7. Import Closure Screen

### Validation Before Close

* All bags inscanned
* No pending mandatory customs data
* Shipment count matches master count

### Actions

* Close Import
* Push to Delivery Module
* Push to Billing

---

# Design Principles Followed

* **Mandatory fields enforced progressively**, not all at once
* **Draft → Operational → Financial flow**
* **Scanner-first UX**
* **Role-based access (Ops / Customs / Accounts)**

---

### Next Steps (You can choose)

I can:

1. Convert this into **database table structure**
2. Provide **MudBlazor page layouts & components**
3. Define **import status timeline & color codes**
4. Create **API contracts (DTOs)**

Tell me what you want next, and I will continue in the same structured manner.
