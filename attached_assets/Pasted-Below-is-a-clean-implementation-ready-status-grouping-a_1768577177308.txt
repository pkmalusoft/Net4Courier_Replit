Below is a **clean, implementation-ready status grouping and shipment status design** optimized specifically for **timeline visualization**, **backend enums**, and **audit-safe progression** in a courier management system.

This structure assumes:

* **One active status at a time**
* **Statuses roll up into logical status groups**
* **Timeline consumes Shipment Status, not Group**
* **Groups help filtering, reporting, and permissions**

## **Recommended Timeline Behavior**

### **Timeline Display Rules**

* Display **Shipment Status only**
* Group header optional (collapsible)
* Each status logs:

  * DateTime
  * Location (Branch / Depot)
  * User / Device
  * Remarks

### **Backward Movement**

Allowed **only within same Status Group**
Cross-group rollback should require **Admin override + audit log**

---

## **Recommended Database Design (Minimal)**

**ShipmentStatusGroup**

* StatusGroupID
* StatusGroupCode
* StatusGroupName
* SequenceNo

**ShipmentStatus**

* StatusID
* StatusCode
* StatusName
* StatusGroupID
* SequenceNo
* IsFinal
* IsException

**ShipmentStatusHistory**

* AWBNo
* StatusID
* StatusDateTime
* LocationID
* UserID
* Remarks

---

## **Next Steps (Optional)**

I can:

* Convert this into **SQL seed data**
* Create **C# enum + lookup mapping**
* Design **timeline UI wireframe**
* Define **allowed status transitions matrix**

Tell me which one you want next.
