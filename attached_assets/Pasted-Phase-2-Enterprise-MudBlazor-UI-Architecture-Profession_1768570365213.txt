Phase-2: Enterprise MudBlazor UI Architecture

(Professional Rate Card, Zone Matrix & Slab Engine Screens)

We will design this as a wizard-style pricing studio, not as isolated forms.
This will drastically reduce errors and speed up tariff creation.

1. Main Module: Rate Card Management

Finance → Pricing → Rate Cards

Open action: Create / Edit Rate Card

Layout: MudTabs (or MudStepper if you prefer guided flow)

4. Tab-3: Weight Slab Rule Builder

Instead of raw rows, provide a Rule Designer.

Each rule:

From Weight

To Weight

Step Weight

Rate per Step

Calculation Mode (Per Step / Per KG / Flat)
